This is my GNU .screenrc file and a simple something to push it to $HOME;

Hopefully large files with all their comments and crap do not take up much screen memory.
I left a lot of the cruft as I tweaked the visuals.


## History:
2009.08.08
I'm not sure when I originally got the .screenrc began modifying it.

I added a neat bottom status bar tweaked it's operation and then modified to colors I like.
Changed the escape key to `
Tried to get some ssh-agent support; Not quite there.

The .screen originally came from Michael Prokop / <online@michael-prokop.at> / www.michael-prokop.at
