# DESCRIPTION:
# This is my GNU .screenrc file and a simple something to push it to $HOME;
# Hopefully large files with all their comments and crap do not take
# up much screen memory. I left a lot of the cruft as I tweaked the visuals.

Changed the escape key to `
Tried to get some ssh-agent support; Not quite there.
